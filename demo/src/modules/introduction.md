CSS has come a long way the past couple years. The movement toward atomic design has given us front-enders a renewed freedom to build experiences that are consistent, modular and extensible, with less focus on pages and more focus on systems. But, as the web transitions to a component-based architecture whereby data flows and updates with the motions of the user, how do we handle styling in a way that is similarly dynamic? Vudu exists to explore these challenges by generating CSS with JavaScript at runtime. Unlike other similar solutions, it also provides utilities out of the box for composing common styles. Here are the primary goals with this approach:

### Composability
Building blocks based on a styleguide that can be infinitely arranged 
### Awareness of State
Styles that adapt to data as it moves throughout the app
### Expressiveness
Declarative styles that are intuitive and easy to reason about
### Simple Interface
Minimal boilerplate and powerful out-of-the-box utilities
### Light and Fast
